# 🧠 AI Logic – FocusOS Intelligence Layer

This file defines the core intelligence behind AI-FocusOS.

Unlike generic chatbots, AI-FocusOS uses **structured input → logic → output mapping**.

---

## 🔁 Input Variables

User provides:
• Goal  
• Skill Level  
• Time Availability  
• Current Challenges  

---

## 🧩 Processing Logic

The system applies these rules:

IF Skill Level = Beginner  
→ Focus on basics + confidence building

IF Time Availability < 1 hour/day  
→ Micro-learning + habit stacking

IF Goal = Career Growth  
→ Skills + roadmap + weekly action plan

IF Goal = Academic Success  
→ Study system + revision cycles + focus blocks

---

## 🎯 Output Structure

Each output contains:

1. Personalized Strategy  
2. Weekly Skill Plan  
3. Focus Routine  
4. AI Coach Advice

---

## 🧬 Why This Is Different

• Not just answers — it builds **systems**  
• Not random — it uses **logic layers**  
• Not static — it adapts per user

---

## 🧪 Example Output

User:  
Goal = Learn AI  
Skill = Beginner  
Time = 45 min/day  

AI-FocusOS Response:

→ Learn Python basics (15 min)  
→ AI concepts (15 min)  
→ Practice mini tasks (15 min)  
→ Weekly project each Sunday

---

This makes AI-FocusOS a **Personal Focus Operating System**, not a chatbot.
